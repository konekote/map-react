**Notes**
- Using the Google Maps React nmp was very difficult as it did not come with complete instructions. This made me understand that it's not necessarily always easier to use something that already exists. 
- Regarding focus, as everything already was in good focus order, I did not change anything.
- My list and list items already have aria roles included so I did not add anything else. 

**Please note that I am currently using my own Google and Foursquare keys!**
