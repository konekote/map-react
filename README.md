**Notes**
- Using the Google Maps React nmp was very difficult as it did not come with complete instructions. This made me understand that it's not necessarily always easier to use something that already exists. 
- Regarding focus, as everything already was in good focus order, I did not change anything.
- My list and list items already have implicit roles of list and list item included. Adding an ARIA role wasn't necessary, however required in order to pass the project. 

**Please note that I am currently using my own Google and Foursquare keys. The Google API key is restricted. PLEASE USE YOUR OWN KEY.**
